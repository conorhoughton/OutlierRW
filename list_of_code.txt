IMPORTANT

rw.jl defines Rw and New and includes their updates, updateRW for either

ou_process.jl defines the ou process and makeGetReward for the outlier rewards

soft_max.jl has a makeSoftMax function for the soft max

background.jl defines the p(r) used in the new rw rule

LESS IMPORTANT

rw_process.jl runs a rw reward process counting rewards and rewards for the optimial process

rw_out_process.jl like rw_process but with outliers

best_eta_rw.jl does an eta sweep for the ou process without outliers

best_eta_rw_out.jl does an eta sweep for the ou process with outliers

best_eta_new_out.jl does an eta sweep for the ou process with outliers and the new rw rule

toy.jl code for testing and playing with the processes

TEST

test_out.jl
test_get_reward.jl
